        <p class="p1">Most airports we fly in and out of are equipped with a Flight Information System. Our airport 
            staff will inform passengers through broadcasts about boarding information and flight irregularities.
             We recommend that passengers who are disabled or have hearing/visual problems relay their
             special needs directly to our employees at each point of contact throughout the airport.</p>
             <p class="p2">
                Most airports we fly in and out of are equipped with jet-bridges and passenger assist lift (PAL) in order to assist disabled
                 passengers with boarding and deplaning. We recommend that you contact us as soon as possible before traveling in order to be 
                 familiar with your destination airport's
                 disability facilities.
